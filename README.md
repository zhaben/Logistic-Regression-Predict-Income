# Logistic-Regression-Predict-Income

I use logistic regression, a classification algorithm, to predict income (binary variable) based on age (continuous variable). Older people are more often classified above 50K, so the results of the model can be interpreted as the probability that a person makes over 50K gets closer to 1 as age increases--or as a person ages she is more likely to make over 50K.
