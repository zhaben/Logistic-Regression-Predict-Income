# Logistic-Regression-Predict-Income

I use logistic regression, a classification algorithm, to predict income (binary variable) based on age (continuous variable). Income increases with age, so the results of the model can be interpreted as the probability that a person makes over 50K gets closer to 1 as age increases.
